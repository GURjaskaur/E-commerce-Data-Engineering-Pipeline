# E-commerce-Data-Engineering-Pipelin
PROJECTS INCLUDES------
1. Data Ingestion
Simulated Data: Since accessing real e-commerce data is difficult, we simulate data using Python scripts. so we have generated transaction logs, user behavior data, and product information using libraries like Faker for realistic fake data.
##Tools: Python (Pandas for data manipulation, Faker for data generation).

2.Data Storage
Local Storage: Instead of using cloud storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, we have stored  data locally in CSV files or SQLite databases.
##tools:
CSV Files: Use Pythonâ€™s csv module or Pandas to save data.
SQLite: Use SQLite, which is a lightweight, file-based database included with Python. It's perfect for local storage.

3.Data Transformation
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Used Python (Pandas) to clean and transform the data as needed. Created ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts that read raw data, perform necessary transformations (e.g., data cleaning, normalization), and stored the processed data as csv file.
##Tools: Python (Pandas, SQLite for database operations).

5. Data Analysis
Analysis and Reporting: Once the data is processed, we have perform analysis using Python, which  calculate average order value (AOV).
##Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib for visualizations).
